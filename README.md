# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-Solution

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. In this project, complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive was done applying the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
